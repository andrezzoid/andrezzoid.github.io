description: A case for remote work and fair compensation for everyone wherever they might live.

Being [back on the job market](https://twitter.com/andrezzoid/status/1194269919476621312) has been good practise and a tremendous learning experience. It's incredible how many companies are hiring remotely these days and how much easier it is to find them and interview with them then it was all those years back when I started my remote journey. If you are hiring remotely, I salute you! 🍺

Because nothing is ever perfect, so working remotely is without it's problems. I guess that remote work is a relatively new thing for most companies and we're all still learning how to do it in a way that feels right for both parties.

One point where I'd like to see more discussion around is regarding how companies calculate what makes a **fair** compensation and I'd like to iterate on why I think that location should not be a part of that calculation.

## Location is an implementation detail

We all understand at least some of the benefits of working remotely, especially the one that comes from being able to live anywhere in the world -- could be because we care to join our significant other in a located job away from home, because we want to be digital nomads and travel the world, because we want to live in the cheapest place possible or because we found an amazing place to call home that's nowhere near our dream job. Whatever it is, it's a great reason and we should not be penalized for it.

The premise of working remotely is that you can do your job in a consistent way without regards to your location. When it comes to technical skills it does not matter what is your origin or where do you live right now. Hell, it doesn't even matter where have you studied [show how Ivy League Schools are not the best].

When it comes to soft skills, location could bear some significance

Perhaps besides some synchronization required for pair programming, 1 to 1's, planning meetings or other timezone sensitive issue, location is

// Show how location is irrelevant for productivity, etc. and should be irrelevant for pay

## Remote as a way of cutting down on costs

Although a less elegant banner for hiring remotely (as opposed to hiring great talent anywhere), cutting down on costs is still a good reason to hire remotely. If we think it through, just the prospect of having remote employees can save money from the start on operational costs such as:

- Office -- we could use a smaller office or no office at all cutting down on recurrent costs for rent, cleaning, maintenance, hardware, food & water, among other things (your mileage may vary);
- Taxes -- if we hire anywhere in the world, chances are we've hired someone outside our country. It's also likely we cannot provide the same type of contract to this person as we would to a national citizen which can potentially reduce costs (eg. in Portugal, the company pays a portion of the employees Social Security, a monthly meal allowance, annual training and a compensation when it let's the employee go);

Sure, cutting down on salaries due to location could save even more money but at the cost of discrimination and inequality.

## Less is worse

In the end fairness may be relative to your point of view. The company decides what is fair for them and if the applicant feels it's a fair opportunity, they have a match. I hate to think some companies may exploit this as a way to pay miserable compensations as they know the applicant has difficulty to find a better opportunity. I have been there, but in a time where finding a remote job was a lot harder. Hopefully nowadays with remote work coming into mainstream this gets mitigated.

It is however important not to be so quick to dismiss the psychological infiriority people will feel in huge gaps in compensation for people in the same skill level just because they are in different locations.

// Fair does not necessarily mean equal, but there must be a sensible threshold
