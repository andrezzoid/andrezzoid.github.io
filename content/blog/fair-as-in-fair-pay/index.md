description: A case for remote work and fair compensation for everyone wherever they might live.

Being [back on the job market](https://twitter.com/andrezzoid/status/1194269919476621312) has been good practise and a tremendous learning experience. It's incredible how many companies are hiring remotely these days and how much easier it is to find them and interview with them then it was all those years back when I started my remote journey. If you are hiring remotely, I salute you! 🍺

Because nothing is ever perfect, so working remotely is without it's problems. I guess that remote work is a relatively new thing for most companies and we're all still learning how to do it in a way that feels right for both parties.

One point where I'd like to see more discussion around is regarding how companies calculate what makes a **fair** compensation and I'd like to iterate on why I think that location should not be a part of that calculation.

> **Fair (adjective /fer/)**
>
> treating people equally without favouritism or discrimination.

## Location is an implementation detail

We all understand at least some of the benefits of working remotely, especially the one that comes from being able to live anywhere in the world -- could be because we care to join our significant other in a located job away from home, because we want to be digital nomads and travel the world, because we want to live in the cheapest place possible or because we found an amazing place to call home that's nowhere near our dream job. Whatever it is, it's a great reason and no one should be penalized for it.

The premise of working remotely is that you can do your job in a consistent way without regards to your location. Working remotely does come with an amount of overhead due it's nature, however, as it relates to your work whithin the company location is really just a detail and bears almost no significance in the outcome, so why should it have any significance in an individual's compensation?

## Remote as a way of cutting down on costs

Although a less elegant banner for hiring remotely (as opposed to hiring great talent anywhere), cutting down on costs is still a good reason to hire remotely. If we think it through, just the prospect of having remote employees can save money from the start on operational costs such as:

- Office -- we could use a smaller office or no office at all cutting down on recurrent costs for rent, cleaning, maintenance, hardware, food & water, among other things;
- Taxes -- chances are we've hired someone outside our country so it's likely we cannot provide the same type of contract to this person as we would to a national citizen. This person would legally be a contractor which can potentially reduce costs (eg. in Portugal, the company pays a portion of the employees Social Security tax, a monthly meal allowance, annual training and a compensation when it let's the employee go);

Your mileage may vary here. Sure, cutting down on salaries due to location could save us even more money but at the cost of inequality.

## Less is worse

Salary gaps for the same position are unfortunately usual in the business but tend to be even higher in remote positions. It's not unusual to have gaps of 30% to 60% when comparing employees in highly expensive cities like San Francisco with other more affordable ones. It is however important not to be so quick to dismiss the psychological effect of inferiority and inequality employees will feel when presented with huge gaps in compensation for the same skill level just because they are in different locations.

## What's fair then?

// TODO

<!-- In the end fairness may be relative to your point of view. The company decides what is fair for them and if the applicant feels it's a fair opportunity, they have a match. I hate to think some companies may exploit this as a way to pay miserable compensations as they know the applicant has difficulty to find a better opportunity. I have been there, but in a time where finding a remote job was a lot harder. Hopefully nowadays with remote work coming into mainstream this gets mitigated.

// Fair does not necessarily mean equal, but there must be a sensible threshold -->

## Conclusion

At the end of the day it's a _job market_ and it's subjected to suply and demand, but we're not playing in the local market anymore, we're worldwide baby so paying slighly above market is no longer enough. To be competitive in the remote work market you have to pay independent of location, you have to pay fair, or pay a much higher price in the long term.
